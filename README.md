# Overview

I created an application that tracks a user's inputted calories versus workout duration. It stores this data and will show this data upon request. It will calculate reports based off of this data, and it treats the data as entries to display.

My goal is to be able to help people keep track of their fitness goals and maintain daily health improvements.

# Cloud Database
The cloud database I am using is Firebase by Google.

The data is stored in Firebase and runs by user authenticity and user input.

# Development Environment

The tools used to develop this was VS Code and Firebase.

I used the Flask library, python, JSON, html and css.

# Future Work

- Add continuing html pages for after a user submits data.
- Include a page that shows a chart where user can click and drag date ranges to create reports.
- Allow the user to see all inputted data in a diary/dictionary format with data association.
